When a workspace is selected on the dashboard, wsx renders a multi-column
detail bar across the bottom. The body is divided into 1–4 equal-width
**containers**; each container holds one or more **modules** stacked
vertically. Five built-in modules ship today: `session_summary`,
`recent_chat`, `processes`, `recent_files`, `model`. The bar's appearance is
controlled by the `detail_bar_config` setting — globally via `wsx config`,
with optional per-repo overrides.

### Schema and defaults

The global value is a full `DetailBarConfig` JSON blob. Every field is
optional; missing fields fall back to defaults. Out-of-range values are
clamped on save (see below).

```json
{
  "visible": true,
  "height": {
    "percent": 30,
    "min_rows": 8,
    "max_rows": 18
  },
  "containers": [
    ["session_summary"],
    ["recent_chat"],
    ["processes", "recent_files"]
  ]
}
```

| Field             | Type          | Default             | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `visible`         | bool          | `true`              | Master toggle. When `false`, the bar is hidden entirely and `Tab` skips the reply input.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `height.percent`  | u8            | `30`                | Target height as a percent of the terminal's rows. Clamped to `[5, 80]`.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `height.min_rows` | u16           | `8`                 | Floor on the bar's height. Clamped to `[4, 40]`.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `height.max_rows` | u16           | `18`                | Ceiling on the bar's height. Clamped to `[4, 60]`. If `min_rows > max_rows`, the two are swapped on save.                                                                                                                                      |
| `containers`      | list of lists | (see default above) | Outer length 1–4: one entry per equal-width column. Inner is a list of module IDs stacked vertically within the column. An empty inner list `[]` reserves an empty column. Empty outer list resets to default. Lengths > 4 are truncated to 4. |

**Built-in module IDs:** `session_summary`, `recent_chat`, `processes`,
`recent_files`, `model`. Unknown IDs render a `[unknown: <id>]` placeholder and
log a warning, so typos are visible but don't break the dashboard.

`model` shows what the workspace's primary agent is **running** on, read from
the live session rather than from its row — so it is a fact, not an intention.
When a [model profile](../configuration/model-profiles.md) has been pinned since
that agent started, a second line names it and says `on next spawn`. A third
appears when other workspaces have live agents on the same endpoint, because
those queue on one server rather than running in parallel.

```text
MODEL
qwen3.8-27b
local-qwen on next spawn
shared with 1 other workspace
```

It has a slot of its own because none of this is visible elsewhere — the
dashboard's agent column is a colour strip with room for one bar per agent and
no text, so a workspace pointed at a local endpoint looks exactly like one on
the default.

`model` is **not in the default layout**, since a workspace that has never been
pinned to a profile has nothing interesting to say. Add it to a container to
turn it on:

```bash
wsx config set detail_bar_config \
  '{"containers": [["session_summary"], ["recent_chat"], ["processes", "recent_files"], ["model"]]}'
```

`session_summary` leads with the workspace's recap — the same
`goal` / `state` / `next` the Project Manager pane shows, one labeled
line per populated field, wrapped to the column:

```
SESSION SUMMARY
▸ goal:  Audit all V2 invoices auto-issued
         today for the CV-04964 drift bug
▸ state: 3 of 12 checked, drift on 2
▸ next:  Fix rounding in issue_v2()
▸ Read×12 Edit×3 Bash×7
▸ working
▸ model: opus 5
```

Each field prefers the long form and falls back to the short one, so a
workspace whose agent only set `--goal-short` still gets a line. A
workspace with no recap at all falls back to the session's first user
prompt, which is what the module always showed before recaps existed.
Because the recap comes from the database rather than the session log,
it appears immediately — it doesn't wait on the `loading…` scan.

When every container is empty (`[[], [], []]`), the bar shrinks to its
4-row chrome (header + two rules + reply input) regardless of
`height.percent`. That's how you trim the bar to just the reply input.

### Setting the global value

```bash
wsx config edit detail_bar_config     # opens $EDITOR; seeded with the pretty-printed default
wsx config set  detail_bar_config '{"height": {"percent": 50}}'
wsx config get  detail_bar_config
wsx config set  detail_bar_config ""  # clear (reverts to baked-in defaults)
```

Partial JSON is fine — `{"visible": false}` is a complete, valid value.
Missing fields are filled in from defaults. Malformed JSON is rejected
with a non-zero exit and the previous value is preserved.

Examples:

```bash
# Make the bar taller on big monitors.
wsx config set detail_bar_config '{"height": {"percent": 45, "max_rows": 24}}'

# Single full-width chat column.
wsx config set detail_bar_config '{"containers": [["recent_chat"]]}'

# Four columns, processes and files in separate slots.
wsx config set detail_bar_config '{"containers": [["session_summary"], ["recent_chat"], ["processes"], ["recent_files"]]}'

# Hide the bar entirely.
wsx config set detail_bar_config '{"visible": false}'
```

### Per-repo override

Each repo can override any subset of the global config. The per-repo
value is a `DetailBarOverride` — `visible` and `height.*` merge
per-field; `containers` is whole-replace when present, fully-inherited
when absent. An empty `{}` inherits everything; you only specify what
you want to change.

Open the repo settings modal with `s` on the dashboard, select the
`detail_bar_config` row, and press Enter. `$EDITOR` opens on `{}\n`
(or the current override). Save to apply; press `d` on the row to
clear the override and fall back to the global value.

Override examples:

Hide the bar entirely for this repo (global value can stay on):

```json
{ "visible": false }
```

Single chat column for this repo; keep `visible` and `height` inherited from global:

```json
{ "containers": [["recent_chat"]] }
```

Taller bar for a repo where the session-summary text is usually long
(CLI tools with verbose tool-call traces):

```json
{ "height": { "percent": 45, "max_rows": 28 } }
```

Merge precedence: bake-in defaults → global `detail_bar_config` →
per-repo override. `visible` and `height.*` apply per-field; `containers`
whole-replaces when the override sets it. So a repo override that only
sets `containers` still picks up any global `height` changes you make
later.

### Behavior on bad input

- Malformed JSON at the global level — falls back to baked-in defaults at runtime, logged at `warn`.
- Malformed JSON in a repo override — the override is ignored; the global value applies, logged at `warn` with the repo name.
- Out-of-range `height.percent` / `min_rows` / `max_rows` — clamped to legal ranges on save (`wsx config set/edit`) and again at runtime as a defense-in-depth.
- `min_rows > max_rows` — swapped on save so the lower bound is the floor and the higher is the ceiling.
