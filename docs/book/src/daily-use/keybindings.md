| `q` / `p` (when digest focused)   | Close the digest (`q` only closes it while the digest is focused — dashboard-focused `q` quits wsx)          |

### Attached workspace

Keystrokes are forwarded to the running `claude` session, except:

| Key              | Action                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl-x d`       | Close the focused pane. When only one pane is open, detaches back to the dashboard (session keeps running). |
| `Ctrl-x Shift-D` | Save the current split layout for this workspace, then detach to the dashboard. Restored on next attach.    |
| `Ctrl-x Esc`     | Dismiss the navigation overlay without detaching (stay in the attached view).                               |
| `Ctrl-x ←/→/↑/↓` | Move focus between split panes in that direction (vim's `Ctrl-w` motions).                                  |
| `Ctrl-x u`       | Open the floating updates panel (shows other workspaces' state; `v`/`s` open in a split, `o` cycles the sort, `/` filters the list) |
| `Ctrl-x a`       | Open the agents panel to add/remove agents and set the model in this workspace (see [Multi-agent workspaces](../configuration/multi-agent-workspaces.md)) |
| `Ctrl-x e`       | Open the attached workspace in your editor (same `editor_cmd` as `[e]` on the dashboard)                    |
| `Ctrl-x t`       | Open the attached workspace in a terminal (same `terminal_cmd` as `[t]`)                                    |
| `Ctrl-x v`       | View diff of the attached workspace's branch vs the base branch (same `diff_cmd` as `[v]`)                  |
| `Ctrl-x k`       | Show processes running under the attached workspace's worktree                                              |
| `Ctrl-x x`       | Send a literal `Ctrl-x` to claude                                                                           |

| `Ctrl-x C`       | Swap the chronology bar's side (left ↔ right)                                                               |
| `Ctrl-x →` (bar on right) / `Ctrl-x ←` (bar on left) | Move keyboard focus into the chronology bar (from the adjacent edge pane only) |
| `Ctrl-x ←` (bar on right) / `Ctrl-x →` (bar on left) | Return focus from the bar to the agent pane                                    |
| `↑` / `k` *(bar focused)* | Move selection up (toward newer entries)                                              |
| `↓` / `j` *(bar focused)* | Move selection down (toward older entries)                                            |
| `g` *(bar focused)*        | Jump to the top (newest entry)                                                        |
| `G` *(bar focused)*        | Jump to the bottom (oldest entry)                                                     |
| `Enter` *(bar focused)*    | Open the full-change detail modal for the selected entry                              |

When a workspace has more than one agent, the footer also binds bare keys `q w r y i o p s h j` (no leader) to switch the focused pane between agents — see [Multi-agent workspaces](../configuration/multi-agent-workspaces.md).
