By default, wsx spawns Claude Code (`claude`) as the coding agent in every workspace. You can choose a different agent per-workspace or set a global default:

```bash
wsx config set coding_agent hermes           # new workspaces use hermes by default
wsx workspace create backend --agent pi      # override for a single workspace
```

Supported agents:

| Agent              | CLI option       | Source                                                                    | Config                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |

### How a model selection is resolved

Setting a model variable on `wsx workspace create` records that choice on the new
workspace's **primary agent row** in `state.db`, and it is read back from there every
time the agent spawns:

```bash
WSX_OMP_MODEL=qwen3.8-27b wsx workspace create backend --agent omp
```

This matters because `workspace create` does not start an agent — it prepares the
worktree, queues any starter prompt, and exits. The agent is spawned later by the TUI,
in a different process that cannot see the environment of the one that created the
workspace. Without the recorded value the variable would simply be lost, and the
workspace would come up on whatever the TUI itself was launched with.

Resolution order at spawn, highest first:

1. the [model profile](model-profiles.md) the agent instance is pinned to,
2. the model/provider recorded on the agent row at creation time,
3. `WSX_<AGENT>_MODEL` / `WSX_<AGENT>_PROVIDER` in the environment of the process that
   spawns the agent — normally the TUI.

So an exported variable still applies to every workspace that has no recorded choice of
its own, which is the behaviour that predates this and is unchanged. A workspace that
does have one keeps it across restarts, and a process-wide variable will not override it.

Selections are stored per *agent instance*, not per workspace: a multi-agent workspace
can therefore run different agents on different models in the same worktree. Blank
values (`export FOO=$UNSET` expands to `""`) read as "not set" rather than being
forwarded to the agent.

Creating a workspace from inside the TUI does not record anything, because there the
creating and spawning processes are the same one — nothing is lost by leaving the value
ambient, and pinning it would stop an exported variable from applying after a relaunch.

### Hermes integration

When a workspace uses `coding_agent: hermes`, wsx spawns `hermes` (or the path in `WSX_HERMES_BIN`) instead of `claude`. Hermes runs in classic REPL mode and receives wsx custom instructions and auto-rename directives.

**AGENTS.md management**: Because Hermes lacks a `--append-system-prompt` flag, wsx injects instructions into a fenced block at the end of `AGENTS.md` in the worktree's working directory:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN wsx-managed -->

…injected instructions…

<!-- END wsx-managed -->
```

The block is rewritten every time Hermes spawns and automatically cleaned up when there's nothing to inject. This approach works whether or not the repository tracks `AGENTS.md` in git:

- **Untracked `AGENTS.md`**: wsx adds it to `.git/info/exclude` so it doesn't show up in `git status`.
- **Tracked `AGENTS.md`**: the worktree will show the file as modified during a Hermes spawn — this is expected and the modification disappears on subsequent spawns when there's no custom instructions to inject.

**Session detection**: On every Hermes spawn, wsx writes a timestamp marker at `<worktree>/.git/info/wsx-hermes-spawn-at` (per-worktree-local, never committed). To find the active Hermes session for a worktree, wsx queries `~/.hermes/state.db` for the most recent session started at or after that timestamp (with a 2-second look-back buffer to absorb clock skew). This drives both the prior-session indicator on the dashboard and the `--resume <id>` flag on Continue spawns. Note: if two worktrees both spawn Hermes within a few seconds of each other, the lookup is best-effort — the more-recent session could be attributed to either worktree depending on timing.

**Session-tail**: wsx tails `~/.hermes/state.db` (sqlite) to populate the dashboard's RECENT CHAT, SESSION SUMMARY, and last-message columns for Hermes workspaces. The following fields are populated: last assistant text, first user prompt, stop reason, tool-use counts, and per-event snapshots (user messages, assistant text, and tool calls — including `ran \`<cmd>\`` display for terminal/bash tool invocations). Tool-use counts treat all Hermes tool names as "other" for now — categorization into read/edit/write/bash buckets is a follow-up since Hermes uses lowercase tool names rather than Claude's capitalized convention. Still missing compared to Claude/Pi: edited-files tracking and pending-tool-use timing for permission-prompt detection.

**Environment overrides**: configure Hermes via `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (persistent settings), or set `WSX_HERMES_MODEL` and `WSX_HERMES_PROVIDER` to override per-workspace (see [How a model selection is resolved](#how-a-model-selection-is-resolved)):

```bash
WSX_HERMES_MODEL=llama-3-70b-instruct WSX_HERMES_PROVIDER=together wsx workspace create backend --agent hermes
```

### Codex integration

When a workspace uses `coding_agent: codex`, wsx spawns `codex` (or the path in `WSX_CODEX_BIN`) instead of `claude`. Codex receives wsx custom instructions and auto-rename directives.

**Instruction injection**: Codex has no `--append-system-prompt` flag, so wsx passes the workspace doctrine, the auto-rename hint, and any custom instructions as a Codex config override on the spawn command line:

```bash
codex -c 'developer_instructions="…injected instructions…"' \
      -c 'project_doc_fallback_filenames=["CLAUDE.md"]'
```

Codex renders `developer_instructions` as the first developer-role message, ahead of its own instructions and ahead of the user-role message that carries `AGENTS.md`. **Nothing is written to your worktree** — no `AGENTS.md`, no `.git/info/exclude` entry. A repo's own `AGENTS.md` is still read by Codex as usual, and `project_doc_fallback_filenames` makes Codex fall back to `CLAUDE.md` in repos that have no `AGENTS.md`. The superpowers-skills doctrine clause is omitted for Codex (those skills install under `~/.claude` and Codex can't load them).

Both overrides are applied only to **fresh** spawns. `codex resume --last` restores the session's stored configuration and ignores these two keys, so a resumed session keeps the doctrine it was started with. It also means edits to a workspace's custom instructions or related-repo context never reach an already-started Codex session — re-attaching with `resume --last` after editing them won't pick up the change, since only a fresh spawn re-composes the `-c` overrides. Requires Codex `0.146.0` or newer.

If a worktree was used with an older wsx, it may contain a wsx-created `AGENTS.md`; deleting it lets the new `CLAUDE.md` fallback work.

**Claude slash commands**: before each Codex spawn, wsx mirrors Markdown files from `~/.claude/commands/` into a local Codex plugin at `~/plugins/wsx-claude-commands/commands/` and registers that plugin in the implicit personal marketplace at `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. The marketplace entry is marked `INSTALLED_BY_DEFAULT`, so commands such as `/pull-request` and `/commit-changes` are available in Codex without maintaining a second command set. Edits to the Claude command files are picked up on the next Codex spawn.

**Spawn**: fresh workspaces launch bare `codex`. Non-yolo sessions use Codex's built-in interactive approvals + workspace-write sandbox; `--yolo` workspaces add `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`.

**Continue**: `codex resume --last`, which Codex filters to the current directory natively — so wsx resumes the worktree's own most-recent session.

**Activity**: the dashboard detail bar tails the worktree's rollout file under `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl`. RECENT FILES is not yet populated for Codex (file edits are inferred-via-shell and not tracked).

**Model**: set `WSX_CODEX_MODEL` to pass `-m <model>` to Codex (e.g. `gpt-5.4`). Unset = Codex default.

### Oh My Pi integration

`omp` is [oh-my-pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi)
(`@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`). It is **not** the same harness as `pi`, which is
`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`. The two share ancestry — which is why they
write the same session-file format — but they are separately maintained, have
different CLIs, and can both be installed at once. `--agent pi` and `--agent
omp` mean different binaries.

**Spawn**: fresh workspaces launch bare `omp`. Non-yolo sessions inherit
whatever `tools.approvalMode` you configured; `--yolo` workspaces add
`--approval-mode yolo`.

**Continue**: `omp -c`. omp resolves `--continue` against the session directory
for the current cwd, so this resumes the worktree's own most-recent session
without wsx needing a marker file or a database query.

**Instructions**: doctrine, the auto-rename directive, and a workspace's custom
instructions compose into a single `--append-system-prompt`. Related-repo paths
ride on `--add-dir`. omp is the only harness besides Claude that supports both
flags, so nothing is written into the worktree — no `AGENTS.md` block (unlike
Hermes) and no config overrides (unlike Codex).

**Skills and slash commands work with no setup.** omp's Claude discovery
provider loads `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` and `~/.claude/commands/*.md`
natively, so the skills installed by `wsx setup install-skill` and your pinned
command chips both reach omp unchanged. There is deliberately no separate omp
skills target — the Claude one already covers it, for the same reason it covers
Pi.

**Session detection and activity**: omp stores sessions at
`~/.omp/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<ts>_<uuid>.jsonl`, where the directory
name is the cwd with `$HOME` (or the temp root) stripped and `/` collapsed to
`-`. Because omp writes the same JSONL schema pi does, wsx reuses the pi parser,
so RECENT CHAT, SESSION SUMMARY, tool-use counts and the last-message column are
populated exactly as they are for Pi. Like Claude, Pi and Codex, omp indexes
sessions by worktree path, so it participates in the worktree-sessions snapshot
that stops a recycled workspace slug from resuming its predecessor's
conversation.

**Status reporting**: omp exposes pre/post *tool* hooks only — there is no
turn-lifecycle event (nothing equivalent to Claude's stop / prompt-submitted /
permission-prompt hooks, or Codex's `notify`) — so there is no deterministic
status wiring, the same position Pi and Hermes are in. Status still updates from
the agent itself calling `wsx status set`, and from the session-JSONL heuristic.
Claude and Codex remain the only harnesses with automatic harness-level status.

**Environment overrides**: configure omp via `~/.omp/agent/config.yml`, or set
`WSX_OMP_MODEL` to override the model per-workspace:

```bash
WSX_OMP_MODEL=anthropic/claude-opus-5 wsx workspace create backend --agent omp
```

There is no `WSX_OMP_PROVIDER`: omp documents `--provider` as legacy and accepts
`provider/id` in `--model`, so `WSX_OMP_MODEL` covers both.
