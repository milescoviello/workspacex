A workspace isn't limited to a single agent. You can attach **additional agents — of the same kind or different kinds — to one workspace.** Every agent runs as its own session but they all share the same git worktree and branch, and they can message each other. This is useful for, say, running a second Claude as a dedicated reviewer alongside the one doing the work, or pitting `claude` and `codex` at the same problem in the same tree.

Every workspace starts with exactly one agent — the **primary**, chosen at creation time by `--agent` or the `coding_agent` setting (see [Coding agents](coding-agents.md)). Everything below is about adding more on top of that.

### Adding and removing agents

In the TUI, press `Ctrl-x a` while a workspace is selected to open the **agents panel**. It lists the agents already attached (the primary is tagged `(primary)`) and an "add" picker of the four kinds:

| Key      | Action                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `↑`/`↓`  | Move through the add picker                             |
| `Enter`  | Add the highlighted kind                                |
| `a`      | Add one of every kind at once                           |
| `x`      | Remove the most-recently-added (non-primary) agent      |
| `p`      | Cycle the primary agent's [model profile](model-profiles.md) |
| `Esc`    | Close the panel                                         |

Newly added agents spawn immediately with the workspace's context injected. The primary can't be removed from the panel — it lives for the life of the workspace.

Each attached agent shows its model in `[brackets]`. When a pin has changed
since that agent started, both are shown — `[claude-opus → local-qwen next
spawn]` — because a process's environment is fixed when it starts, so the change
waits for a respawn. Without that arrow the keypress looks like it did nothing.

`p` walks the **primary** agent through the configured profiles and then back
off the end, so the agent's own default is always reachable without leaving the
panel. It is a cycle rather than a picker because the profile list is short and
user-defined, and a second modal on top of a modal earns nothing for a list that
is usually two entries long.

An agent added to a pinned workspace **inherits that workspace's model**, so
pressing "add" in a workspace on a local endpoint does not quietly start a
second agent somewhere else. To give one a model of its own — which is the whole
reason this is stored per instance rather than per workspace — address it by
label:

```bash
wsx agent profile --agent claude#2 some-other-profile
wsx agent profile --agent claude#2 --clear
```

From the CLI, the equivalent of the panel's "add" is:

```bash
wsx agent add <kind>     # kind = claude | pi | hermes | codex | omp
```

This runs against the **current** workspace — the one whose worktree you're in, or the one named by `$WSX_WORKSPACE_ID` (see [identity](#agent-identity-and-labels) below). It prints the new agent's label, e.g. `added claude#2`.

### Switching focus between agents

When a workspace has more than one agent, the attached view grows a **footer agents row** listing each agent with a single-letter switch key:

```
agents:  ▎claude q   ▎codex w   ▎pi r
```

Press the key (`q`, `w`, `r`, …) to point the focused pane at that agent's session, or click the pill. The keys are drawn from a fixed pool — `q w r y i o p s h j` — assigned in display order (primary first). A workspace with more than ten agents renders the rest keyless, but they stay clickable. The row only appears once a second agent exists; a single-agent workspace looks exactly as before.

Because agents share the worktree, switching focus is just changing which session your keystrokes go to — there's no branch-swapping or checkout involved.

### Inter-agent messaging

Agents can send each other messages — a peer in the same workspace by default, or any agent in another workspace with `--workspace`:

```bash
wsx agent send [--workspace <repo>/<slug>] <label> <message…>
```

`<label>` is an agent's footer/list label (`claude`, `claude#2`, `codex`, …),
or the reserved label `primary` for the workspace's primary agent. The rest of
the line is the message body. Without `--workspace` the target is the current
workspace; with it, any workspace — which is how one agent hands a task to a
freshly created workspace's agent. Delivery is **asynchronous**: the message is
queued and injected into the target's session on the next tick, prefixed with a
banner so the recipient knows where it came from:

```
[message from claude#2]
…your message body…
```

A sender in a *different* workspace is qualified with its `<repo>/<slug>`, so
the recipient can see which workspace the work came from:

```
[message from workspacex/parent-task claude]
…your message body…
```

If the sender is the `wsx` CLI itself (not another agent — i.e. `$WSX_AGENT_INSTANCE_ID` is unset), the banner is just `[message]`. If the target agent isn't running yet, wsx spawns it first, then delivers. Sending to a label that doesn't exist in the target workspace errors with that workspace's agent labels listed inline (`wsx agent list` only reports the current workspace, so it can't describe another one).

Queued messages are injected by the running `wsx` TUI, so `wsx agent send`
warns on stderr when no dashboard is running — the message stays queued and is
delivered when one starts.

Delivery waits for the target agent to be ready to accept input: its TUI must
be up (not still booting) and its output quiet. A cold agent takes a second or
two to get there, and one that's midway through a turn takes as long as the
turn does — the message lands at its prompt rather than mid-work. A message is
only marked delivered once it has actually been written to the agent's
terminal; if the write doesn't happen, it stays queued and is retried. After
several failed attempts wsx stops retrying and the workspace's dashboard row
shows a red `✉!` badge, so an undeliverable message is visible rather than
silently dropped. Restarting `wsx` clears the attempt counts and retries.

Mail queued while no dashboard was running is delivered when one starts. Only
one message at a time is injected into any given agent — messages that arrive
while a delivery is in flight wait their turn, so they can't interleave in the
agent's terminal.

A message counts as delivered only when the terminal write for it is
acknowledged, so a queued write that never reaches the agent is retried rather
than recorded as sent.

Delivery is *at-least-once* across a crash: if `wsx` dies after writing a
message into an agent's terminal but before recording it as delivered, the
message is still queued and will be injected again when `wsx` restarts. The
in-flight bookkeeping that prevents duplicates is in memory, so it does not
survive the process.

Since all agents write to the same files, prefer messaging to hand off work rather than editing the same paths in parallel.

### Listing agents

```bash
wsx agent list
```

Prints one agent per line — its instance id and label, with `(primary)` appended for the primary — for the current workspace:

```
1  claude  (primary)
2  claude#2
4  codex
```

The leading number is the agent's instance id — the same value wsx injects as `$WSX_AGENT_INSTANCE_ID` into that agent's session.

### Agent identity and labels

Each agent instance has a **label** derived from its kind and its ordinal within that kind: the first of a kind is the bare name (`claude`), and each subsequent one of the same kind gets a `#N` suffix (`claude#2`, `claude#3`). The same rule produces the labels shown in the footer row, in `wsx agent list`, and in message banners.

When wsx spawns an agent it injects two environment variables into that session, so the agent (or scripts it runs) can address the multi-agent CLI without guessing:

| Variable                 | Value                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `WSX_WORKSPACE_ID`       | The workspace this agent belongs to                |
| `WSX_AGENT_INSTANCE_ID`  | This specific agent instance                       |

`wsx agent` commands resolve the "current" workspace from `$WSX_WORKSPACE_ID` first, falling back to matching the current directory against known worktrees — so the commands work both from inside an agent session and from a plain shell in the worktree. `wsx agent send` uses `$WSX_AGENT_INSTANCE_ID` to stamp the `[message from …]` sender on outgoing messages.

`--workspace <repo>/<slug>` overrides that resolution for the *target*;
`$WSX_AGENT_INSTANCE_ID` still identifies the sender, which is how a
cross-workspace message gets its `<repo>/<slug>`-qualified banner.
