    This is a wsx-managed workspace, and the work here is rarely trivial. Unless \
    the task is plainly simple, treat the following as your default, \
    non-negotiable operating mode. You may stand a practice down only if, after \
    evaluating, the task clearly does not warrant it.";

const CLAUSE_PLAN: &str = "- Think and plan before acting. Determine scope first, \
    applying maximum effort and explicit planning until the scope is clear. Do not \
    start editing code before you understand what you are building.";

const CLAUSE_SUPERPOWERS: &str = "- Use the superpowers skills by default when \
    evaluating the initial request. If the task turns out not to need that level \
    of planning, you may discard them and proceed.";

const CLAUSE_COMMITS: &str = "- Break the work into logical commits on this branch. \
    A workspace that ends with a single commit should be the exception, reserved \
    for the simplest tasks — not the norm.";

    for workspace and cross-repo operations in this environment; consult it before \
    running wsx commands.";

const CLAUSE_HANDOFF_OUT: &str = "- Start a new workspace instead of a new branch. \
    When the work ahead needs a new branch, or shifts to a concern independent \
    enough that this session's history would be noise, do not branch here — \
    create a workspace and hand the task to its own agent: \
    `wsx workspace create <repo> --name <slug>`, then \
    `wsx agent send --workspace <repo>/<slug> primary \"<brief>\"`. Always pass \
    `--name`; an unnamed workspace forces the new agent to rename it before it \
    can start. The new workspace inherits this workspace's yolo mode, agent \
    kind and model automatically — do not pass `--yolo`, and pass `--agent` or \
    `--profile` only to deliberately pick a different one. The brief is the receiving agent's ONLY context: state the task \
    and what done looks like, why it exists, the decisions and file:line \
    pointers it needs, the constraints, and the first concrete step — write it \
    so it still makes sense if this session were deleted. Then tell the user \
    which workspace is now working on what and return to your own task; do NOT \
    `cd` into the new worktree and work there yourself.";

const CLAUSE_HANDOFF_IN: &str = "- If your first input is a handoff brief from \
    another workspace's agent (banner: `[message from <repo>/<slug> <label>]`), \
    that brief is your task. Set `wsx recap set --goal` from it before you start.";

const CLAUSE_STATUS: &str = "- Report your status as you go with `wsx status set \
    <working|waiting|blocked|done> --message \"<one line>\"`: `working` when you start \
    substantive work, `blocked` when you need a decision or answer from the user, \
    `waiting` when parked on something external (a build, CI, a long command), and \
    `done` when the task is finished. This keeps the wsx dashboard accurate.";

const CLAUSE_RECAP: &str = "- Maintain the workspace recap with `wsx recap set`: run \
    `wsx recap set --goal \"<one line>\"` once you understand the task's scope, and \
    update `--state \"<one line>\"` and `--next \"<one line>\"` whenever you set status \
    and whenever you end a turn with the task unfinished. Alongside each full field, \
    keep keyword short forms for the dashboard row: `--goal-short` (≤40 chars), \
    `--state-short` and `--next-short` (≤24 chars) — telegraphic style: identifiers \
    and ticket/PR numbers only, no articles (a/an/the), no filler verbs. \
    Example: --goal \"Audit all V2 invoices auto-issued today for the \
    CV-04964 amount-drift bug fixed in PR #2835\" --goal-short \"Audit V2 invoices, \
    CV-04964, bug #2835\". The project-manager digest renders the full lines; the \
    dashboard row renders the short forms.";
